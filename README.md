# **Library Management System**  

ðŸ“š **A simple web app to manage your book collection**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a **Library Management System** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to:  
- **Add** new books with details like title, author, pages, and read status.  
- **Display** books in an organized layout (cards or table).  
- **Remove** books from the library.  
- **Toggle** the read status of each book.  

All book data is stored in an array, ensuring **separation between data logic and UI rendering** for better maintainability.

## **Features**  
âœ” **Book Constructor** â€“ Creates book objects with unique IDs (`crypto.randomUUID()`).  
âœ” **Add Books** â€“ Submit form entries to dynamically add books to the library.  
âœ” **Display Books** â€“ Loop through the array and render books in a clean UI.  
âœ” **Remove Books** â€“ Delete books by their unique ID.  
âœ” **Toggle Read Status** â€“ Update whether a book has been read or not.  
âœ” **Form Handling** â€“ Prevents default submission using `event.preventDefault()`.

## **Setup & Usage**  
1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/CarlosEduardoMdO/Library.git
   cd Library
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a browser**  

3. **Add a book**  
   - Click **"New Book"**.  
   - Fill in details (title, author, pages, read status).  
   - Submit to see it appear in your library!  

4. **Manage books**  
   - **Delete** a book by clicking the remove button.  
   - **Toggle read status** with the "Read/Unread" button.

## **Technical Notes**  
ðŸ”¹ **Unique IDs** â€“ Each book gets a stable `id` via `crypto.randomUUID()`.  
ðŸ”¹ **Separation of Concerns** â€“ Data logic (`myLibrary`) is separate from rendering (`renderBooks()`).  
ðŸ”¹ **Form Handling** â€“ `event.preventDefault()` prevents unwanted page reloads.  

---

## **Future Improvements**  
- **LocalStorage** â€“ Persist books between sessions.  
- **Search/Filter** â€“ Find books by title/author.  
- **Responsive Design** â€“ Better mobile support.
